## Implementation Instructions

### For Academic Submission:
1. **Create actual diagrams** using the specifications above
2. **Replace placeholder commands** with actual figure includes:
   ```latex
   \begin{figure}[htbp]
   \centering
   \includegraphics[width=0.8\textwidth]{diagrams/architecture.png}
   \caption{System Architecture Overview}
   \label{fig:architecture}
   \end{figure}
   ```

3. **Save diagrams** in a `diagrams/` folder within your project
4. **Use consistent styling** across all diagrams (fonts, colors, spacing)

### Recommended Tools:
- **Professional**: Adobe Illustrator, Visio
- **Free Online**: Draw.io (diagrams.net), Lucidchart
- **Programmatic**: TikZ (LaTeX), Python matplotlib/seaborn
- **Quick Creation**: PowerPoint, Google Drawings

### Export Settings:
- **Format**: PNG or PDF (vector preferred)
- **Resolution**: 300 DPI minimum
- **Size**: Width should fit within column width (IEEE format)
- **Colors**: Colorblind-friendly palette

The current placeholders will show as bordered boxes with descriptions when you compile the LaTeX. You can replace them with actual figures once created. Would you like me to help generate any specific diagrams using a particular tool, or create sample code for generating the charts programmatically?
